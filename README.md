Grading student assignments is a fundamental aspect of the educational process, serving as a critical means of assessing student learning and providing feedback for improvement. However, traditional manual grading methods are often labor-intensive, prone to human error, and subject to individual biases, leading to inconsistencies in assessment outcomes. In today’s educational landscape, where the focus is increasingly on personalized learning and equitable assessment practices, the need for fair and objective grading mechanisms has become more important than ever. Teachers face many challenges when grading, like handling a lot of assignments, keeping the grading fair, and giving feedback quickly. Also, sometimes personal opinions can affect the grades, which isn’t fair to all students. Addressing these challenges requires innovative approaches that leverage technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and fairness of the grading process. This project aims to develop a new system for suggesting grades using AI (artificial intelligence), which will revolutionize the grading process. By employing advanced technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with the Google Vision API and AI Models (specifically OpenAI GPT-3), our goal is to streamline grading and improve its accuracy.The main goal of this project is to overcome the limitations of manual grading by leveraging advanced technologies. Through the use of the Google Vision API, handwritten assignments can be converted into text format. This text is then sent to the OpenAI API for grading and feedback, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the grading process
